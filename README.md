- 👋 Hi, I’m @JP-Alchemy
- 👀 I’m interested in changing the world through innovating and telling stories while influencing others to make a change in the world we live in.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can, with technology from 3D rendering pipelines, shaders and new technology stacks on the web!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D enviroments, story telling and creating things that can change the way we understand the world.
